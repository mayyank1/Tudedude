// #--> pre-processor directives

using namespace std;  //namespace-->helps the compiler determine which name pieces of code. symbol declared inside a namespace block are placed in a named scope that prevents them from being mistaken for identically-named symbols in other scopes.

int main()    //main function--> when the code is run , all the elements within the main() function are executed
{

    cout<< "Hello, World!";   //all the code

    return 0;   //return to OS
}
